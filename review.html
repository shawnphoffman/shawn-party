                <h2>New year. New job. New state.</h2>

                <p>First of all, welcome to my version of "year end holiday car update about Shawn". As some of you may already know, last year was a huge year for me. It included a big move across the country as well as a bunch of exciting family events.</p>

                <h3>Silicon Valley</h3>
                <p>Probably the biggest change for me in 2015 was the move out to California for my new job. 2015 marked 3 years with Sogeti and I decided that it was time to move on and see what else was out there. During a trip to California to visit a good friend, I was introduced to <a href="http://dynamicsignal.com/" target="_blank">Dynamic Signal</a> and proceeded to pursue a career out in Silicon Valley. The move wasn't easy as it put me thousands of miles away from my family but they have been nothing but supportive and the impact it has had on my career has been outstanding.</p>
                <div class="image halfsie">
                    <img src="img/silicon_valley.gif" />
                    <span>"Hey bro, let me tell you about my startup..."</span>
                </div>

                <p>I currently live in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MjC5Q9oQB4m" target="_blank">Palo Alto</a>, home of Stanford University, and about 30 minutes south of San Francisco. Since I don't need one, I got rid of my car in favor or riding CalTrain to get around, which is a huge change from what I was used to in Indiana</p>

                <h3>Weddings and such</h3>
                <p>This year I was honored to be in my brother's wedding. The weather was beautifully hot and it was really awesome to see the two families come together and celebrate.</p>

                    <span>Jeff's Wedding</span>
                </div>

                <h3>Misc Adventures</h3>

                <h4>Yosemite</h4>
                <p>Before I moved out to California, I came out to simply visit Madison and take a trip to Yosemite. We went hiking all day on Four Mile Trail and got to see stunning views of Yosemite Falls, El Capitan, and Half Dome. It was an amazing trip and I encourage everyone to visit there at least once during their lifetime.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h4>The Lost Coast</h4>
                <p>When I moved to California, I had about a week before I started work and managed to participate in an extended backpacking trip to the <a href="https://lostcoasttrails.wordpress.com/">Lost Coast</a> with a bunch of friends over 4th of July weekend. Over the course of a couple days we hiked across miles of blackened beaches, saw a beached whale, climbed King's Range up a ridiculously steep incline to the other side where it was blistering hot, and then came back down the other side. The scenery was absolutely beautiful. Pictures don't do it justice but they certainly help give you an idea.</p>

                <h4>Memphis</h4>
                <p>For Thanksgiving, I traveled with Madison to her hometown of Memphis, Tennesee. While we were there I was treated with unparalled southern hospitality, tons of barbeque, drinking until the sun came up, good cooking, and endless baked goods from Muddy's Bake Shop. We visited the Peabody, Memphis University, the house where she grew up, her dad's shop, the Lorraine Hotel, and much more. I had a blast and look forward to going back.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h4>Carmel &amp; Big Sur</h4>
                <p>Considering the expense of moving across the country, I wasn't able to spend the holidays in Indiana this year. Thankfully we live in a day in age where we can FaceTime with our loved ones across the globe in real-time. This is exactly what I did this past holiday season from Carmel, California. Carmel is a quaint town near Monterrey and Big Sur. Madison and I spent the week dog-sitting for some friends and enjoying the beaches and amazing surroundings including the Esalen Hot Springs.</p>

                <h4>Star Wars 7-Movie Marathon</h4>
                <p>For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to participate in a 7-movie marathon leading up to the release of the newest Star Wars film. Needless to say, it was an experience and well worth it. That being said, I don't believe I will ever be doing that again.</p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="img/star_wars_1.jpg" />
                </div>

                <h4>Flat Stanley</h4>
                <p>While in California, I want to make sure I take advantage of everything the West Coast has to offer while I'm here. In 2015, my nephew Graham's class participated in the Flat Stanley program and sent his out to visit me. This gave me even more incentive to travel around the area and visit places like Big Sur, Golden Gate Park, and the Santa Cruz boardwalk.</p>

                <h4>Shades State Park (Indiana)</h4> 
                <p>Spent a whole day hiking every trail here by myself. Highly recommend!</p>
