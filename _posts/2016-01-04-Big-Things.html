<h3>Disney World: Star Wars - Dark Side Challenge</h3>
<p>In April I will be running a 10K and a half marathon over the course of 2 days. I'm partnered with Noah's Light Foundation to help raise donations for pediatric brain cancer research, awareness, and care. I'm super excited and could use all the help I can get.</p>

<h3>Parents Visiting California</h3>
<p>I'm super excited that my parents are going to be making a trip out to visit me this year. Madison is feverishly planning all sorts of exciting activities to keep us busy.</p>

<h3>Vacation Back to Indiana</h3>
<p>Spending some time back in Indiana to visit with family, friends, and the new <em>baby raspberry</em>.</p>

<h3>Cousin's Wedding in Texas</h3>
<p>Since I wasn't able to make the big family reunion last year, I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss out this year so I will be flying out to Texas to visit with extended family at my cousin Lori's wedding.</p>

<h3>Friend's Wedding in Colorado</h3>
<p>Madison has been asked to be a bridesmaid in a wedding for a friend that dates all the way back to when her and I worked for Disney during the College Program. We'll be flying out to Evergreen, Colorado for the wedding and surely more.</p>

<h3>Holy crap, I'm going to be 30...</h3>
<p>I turn 30 this year...</p>
