<p>Over Martin Luther King weekend, I ran my first half marathon since 2011 down in Anaheim. Madison surprised me for my birthday with registration as I had been continuously talking about how I wanted to do one. Not only did I love the race but it was my first time visiting Disneyland so it was an especially magical weekend.</p>
