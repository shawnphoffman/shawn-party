<h4>Shades State Park (May)</h4>
<p>Spent a whole day hiking every trail here by myself. Highly recommend for all of my Indiana friends!</p>

<h4>Yosemite (April)</h4>
<p>Before I moved out to California, I came out to visit Madison (now girlfriend) and take a trip to Yosemite National Park. We went hiking all day on Four Mile Trail and got to see stunning views of Yosemite Falls, El Capitan, and Half Dome. It was an amazing trip and I encourage everyone to visit there at least once during their lifetime.</p>

<h4>The Lost Coast (July)</h4>
<p>When I moved to California, I had about a week before I started work and managed to participate in an extended backpacking trip to the <a href="https://lostcoasttrails.wordpress.com/">Lost Coast</a> with a bunch of friends over 4th of July weekend. Over the course of a couple days we hiked across miles of blackened beaches, saw a beached whale, climbed King's Range up a ridiculously steep incline to the other side where it was blistering hot, and then came back down the other side. The scenery was absolutely beautiful. Pictures don't do it justice but they certainly help give you an idea.</p>

<h4>Wedding Bells (July)</h4>
<p>This year I was honored to be in my brother's wedding. The weather was beautifully hot and it was really awesome to see the two families come together and celebrate.</p>

<h4>Flat Stanley (Fall)</h4>
<p>While in California, I want to make sure I take advantage of everything the West Coast has to offer while I'm here. My nephew's (Graham) class participated in the Flat Stanley program and he proceeded to send his Flat Stanley out to California to visit me. This gave me even more incentive to travel around the area and document places like Big Sur, Golden Gate Park, and the Santa Cruz boardwalk for the kids back in Indiana to learn about.</p>

<h4>Memphis (November)</h4>
<p>For Thanksgiving, I traveled with Madison to her hometown of Memphis, Tennesee. While we were there I was treated with unparalled southern hospitality, tons of barbeque, drinking until the sun came up, good cooking, and endless baked goods from <a href="http://www.muddysbakeshop.com/" target="_blank">Muddy's Bake Shop</a>. We visited the <a href="http://www.peabodymemphis.com/ducks-en.html" target="_blank">Peabody Hotel (home to a few unusual residents)</a>, Memphis University, the house where she grew up, her dad's shop, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Civil_Rights_Museum" target="_blank">Lorraine Motel</a>, and much more. I had a blast and look forward to going back.</p>

<h4>Star Wars 7-Movie Marathon (December)</h4>
<p>For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to participate in a 7-movie marathon leading up to the release of the newest Star Wars film. Needless to say, it was an experience and well worth it. That being said, I don't believe I will ever be doing that again.</p>

<h4>Carmel &amp; Big Sur (December)</h4>
<p>Considering the expense of moving across the country, I wasn't able to spend the holidays in Indiana this year. Thankfully we live in a day in age where we can FaceTime with our loved ones across the globe in real-time. This is exactly what I did this past holiday season from Carmel, California. Carmel is a quaint town near Monterrey and Big Sur. Madison and I spent the week dog-sitting for some friends and enjoying the beaches and amazing surroundings including the <a href="http://www.esalen.org/page/esalen-hot-springs" target="_blank">Esalen Hot Springs</a>.</p>
