<p>Probably the biggest change for me in 2015 was the move out to California for my new job. July marked my 3 year anniversary with Sogeti and I decided that it was time to move on and see what else was available. While visiting a friend in California, I was introduced to <a href="http://dynamicsignal.com/" target="_blank">Dynamic Signal</a> and proceeded to pursue one of their open positions that happened to align perfectly with my experience and career goals. The move wasn't easy as it put me thousands of miles away from my family but they have been nothing but supportive and the impact it has had on my career has been outstanding.</p>

<p>â€‹I reside in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MjC5Q9oQB4m" target="_blank">Palo Alto</a>, home to Stanford University and the epicenter of Silicon Valley. Also conveniently 30 miles south of San Francisco, who claims the title of Super Bowl host this year, and 15 miles north of Levi's Stadium in San Jose, where the game will actually play. That's 45 miles for those of you counting.</p>
