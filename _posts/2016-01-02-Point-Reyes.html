<p>Madison and I both managed to have an off-weekend so we took advantage of it by hiking around San Pedro Valley and Tomales Point with some friends. Tomales Point had some of the strongest winds I've ever experienced in my life but the views of the wild elk were totally worth it. We went to San Pedro Valley because it was listed as having "scenic waterfall views" but as you can see below, the California drought has limited the waterfall to a sad trickle.</p>
